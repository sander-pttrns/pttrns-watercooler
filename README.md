# Water Cooler App

Water Cooler is a custom Teams app that enables corporate teams to create, invite, and join casual conversations among teammates, like those that take place by the Water Cooler or break room. Use this template for multiple scenarios, such as new non-project related announcements, topics of interest, current events, or conversations about hobbies.

The app provides an easy interface for anyone to find an existing conversation or start a new one. It's a foundation for building custom targeted communication capabilities, promoting interaction amongst coworkers who may otherwise not get a chance to socialize during breaks.

## Architecture
![Architecture](Wiki/Images/architecture.png)

The __Water Cooler__ app has the following main components:
* __App Service (API)__: The API app service will provide the API endpoints to get the Rooms Data, its participants, and to Add a New Room. 
* __App Service (UI)__: The UI app service will display the Rooms and the participants in the room. 
* __Azure Storage__: Azure Storage tables will store the Room Data and the participants information in the tables.
* __Microsoft Graph API__: The app leverages Microsoft graph APIs to [List Participants](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/call-list-participants?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http), [Get User Profile.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/profile-get?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http)

## App Service
The app service implements two main concepts, Endpoints for displaying the calls and a scheduler job for updating the participant info.

#### API Endpoint
The end point will return all the active rooms by checking the azure storage tables. The azure storage tables will provide all active rooms. By utilizing the graph API, we will get the active participants in the call and return it data back to the UI. All these methods will be implemented using parallel async calls.

#### Scheduler
The scheduler will run for specified time and update database with the following things. It will loop through all the active calls and get the desired information from graph and based on the database records it will update or insert the records. E.g.: Currently there are 4 active users in the room. When the scheduler runs for the first time it will insert all 4 records. In next scheduler event we have a new participant in the call it will check for the change and as the new user is there it will insert the data. If any other user dropped off it will update the meeting end time for the user.

#### UI
The UI will fetch all the rooms and participants from the above-mentioned API and display the tiles information. The tile will have the Room name, description, participants list and a button to join the call. If the user is part of the call the join button will be displayed. Apart from that the first will be fixed and it will have the create new room button. Click on the button to open the dialog box with Room Name, Description and Participants list. After saving the Room a new call will be initiated. Bot will join the call and it will call other users who are invited initially. The UI application will continuously the poll the API to get the latest rooms information.

## Microsoft Graph API

## Deployment Guide

Deployment of the Water Cooler app will take approx. 90 minutes, assuming all pre-requisites are in place. 

### Pre-requisites

Please make sure you are ready with the following list:

1. __Access to [ https://portal.azure.com]( https://portal.azure.com)__
   1. You will need an active subscription with credit available
   2. Note: You will need to create a new Resource Group and be able to deploy Azure Services into it
2. __Access to run PowerShell on your local machine (as Administrator) connecting to a Microsoft Teams Tenant. This is needed to create the Policy allowing the Water Cooler app to make calls inside your tenant. Or you can use Azure cloud shell instead of PowerShell on local machine.__
   1. When running the PowerShell your user account will need to have the Teams Administrator Role – or – be Global Administrator.
   2. Learn more: [ Use Microsoft Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/using-admin-roles)
3. __Permissions to submit/approve a Teams App for use in your tenant via the Teams Admin Centre__
   1. This allows users to find and access the app

### Deployment steps
1. __Register Azure AD application__: Register an Azure AD application in your tenant's directory for Water Cooler app.
    1. Log in to the Azure Portal for your subscription, and go to the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) blade.
    2. Click __New registration__ to create an Azure AD application.
       1. __Name__: Name of your Teams App - if you are following the template for a default deployment, we 
          recommend "Water Cooler".

       1. Application (client) ID for the Water Cooler app.
       2. Client secret for the Water Cooler app.
       3. Directory (tenant) ID. (Get from the app overview page or Azure AD) 

       We recommend that you copy the values, we will need them later. 
       ![App Data](Wiki/Images/appData.png)


2. __Deploy your Azure subscription__
    1. Click on the __Deploy to Azure__ button below.

       [![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fcsapps-msteams-watercooler%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Fazuredeploy.json)
    2. When prompted, log in to your Azure subscription. 
    3. Azure will create a "Custom deployment" based on the Water Cooler ARM template and ask you to fill 
       in the template parameters.

       __IMPORTANT NOTE__: Please ensure that you **don't use underscore (_) or space** in any of the field values otherwise the deployment may fail.
    4. Select a subscription and a resource group.
       1. We recommend creating a new resource group.
       2. The resource group location __MUST__ be in a datacenter that supports all the following:
          1. Storage Accounts
          2. Application Insights
          3. App Service
          4. Azure Bot Services

            For an up-to-date list of datacenters that support the above, click [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=monitor,bot-services,storage,app-service)

         ![PowerShell](Wiki/Images/powershell.png)

6. __Create the Teams app package__
   
   Now everything is deployed in Azure, we need to package up the Teams App and add it into Teams!

   1. Make sure you have cloned the app repository locally.
   2. Open the  Manifest\manifest.json file in a text editor.
   3. Change the placeholder fields in the manifest to values appropriate for your organization in developer property.
      1. `MenifestVersion = 1.5`
      2. `Version = 1.0.0`
      3. `id` = `Client ID`
      3. `developer.name` = Microsoft ([What's this?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#developer)) 
      4. `developer.websiteUrl`
      5. `developer.privacyUrl`
      6. `developer.termsOfUseUrl` (This should be the same Terms of use URL used in step 4 ->15-> 2)
   [Note: These 3 URLs should be different]
   4. Change the placeholder fields in the manifest to values appropriate to app name property
      1. short: “`Water Cooler`”,
      2. Full: “`Water Cooler`”
      3. Description.short = Must be less than 80 characters in length
   5. Change the placeholder fields in the manifest as an example below:
      1. "entityId": "`waterCooler`",
      2. "name": "`Water Cooler`",
      3. "contentUrl": `https://yourappserviceurl.azurewebsites.net/`,
      4. "websiteUrl": `"https://yourappserviceurl.azurewebsites.net/`",
   6. Change the `<<clientId>>` placeholder in the id setting of the webApplicationInfo section to be the `%clientId%` value. Change the `<<appDomain>>` placeholder in the resource setting of the webApplicationInfo section to be the `%appDomain%` value e.g. `api://appname.azurewebsites.net/clientId`.
   7. Create a ZIP package with the  manifest.json, color.png, and outline.png. The two image files are the icons for your app in Teams.
      1. Name this package  `manifest.zip`, so you know that this is the app for the Water Cooler.
      2. Make sure that the 3 files are the top level of the ZIP package, with no nested folders.

         ![Manifest](Wiki/Images/manifest.png)

7. __Install app in Microsoft Teams__

   1. Install the Water Cooler app (the  manifest.zip package)
      1. You can do this through the Teams Admin Centre -> Teams Apps -> Manage Apps -> Upload -> Select a File -> Choose Manifest.zip you just created
      2. If your tenant has sideloading apps enabled, you can install your app by following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-upload#load-your-package-into-teams).

8. __Upload room icons to blob storage__
